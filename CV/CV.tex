    \subsection{EEG Controlled Prosthetic}
    \vspace{-0.5em} % Adjust the space as needed
    \normalsize{Used Python to develop software that can control a 3D printed
    prosthetic by reading real-time brain data. The software mimics
    an EEG brain-reading device and outputs the data similarly to
    what an EEG device would. The other part of the software reads
    in the data with the help of sockets; the software then processes
    it into a graph using Matplotlib.}

    \vspace{-0.5em} % Adjust the space as needed
    \normalsize{I am currently working on a web-based STL searching tool that will allow users to search through archive file formats such as .zip or .7z. The tool consists of 2 components: a searching component, and a viewing component. The viewer is a full 3D viewing system like CAD or 3D printing slicer software, allowing the user to view each STL file in 3D space. The tool is written in React.js and Three.js. Currently in the optimisation phase of development.}
