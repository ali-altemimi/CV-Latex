\section{Experience}
\subsection{Research Intern - \textnormal{University of Hull - Hull} \footnotesize{(AUGUST 2022 - NOVEMBER 2022)}}
During my 10-week internship at the Universities of Hull Department of Physics I designed and developed software written in python for a custom 3D printer that is designed to print both electronic components and thermoplastics. The software was initially designed to be simple and to expand yet able to incorporate complex algorithms. The main feature was the ability to incorporate 2 separate gcode files into one print session allowing 1 gcode file to be "embedded" into another gcode file.

\subsection{Junior Software Engineer - \textnormal{Global View Systems - Hull} \footnotesize{(OCTOBER 2021 - MARCH 2022)}}
\noindent
Worked on our greenfield project as a front-end .NET developer, the software was mainly targeted at NHS auditors to help with the downtime of specific rooms and equipment. Allows management to track upcoming and in-progress audits including major yearly audits such as efficacy audits. Performed maintenance work on our feature complete porter software which was focused on NHS porters.

        \item[$\bullet$]Expanded the scope of the initial software tool created during my internship to include the creation of custom gcode. 
        \item[$\bullet$]Developed a 2D line-by-line simulated gcode visualiser with the help of DearPyGui.
        \item[$\bullet$]Implement a feature set that enables seamless operation of the 3D printing, allowing the user to start printing and having the printer automatically print both ink and plastic with little user input or overhead.
        \item[$\bullet$]Conducted hands-on testing of the software with the printer including both conductive ink and plastic printing.
        \item[$\bullet$]Developed a feature enabling the integration of any gcode file with various infill settings for compatibility with our custom hybrid 3D printer.

    \normalsize{Used Python to develop software that can control a 3D printed
    prosthetic by reading real-time brain data. The software mimics
    an EEG brain-reading device and outputs the data similarly to
    what an EEG device would. The other part of the software reads
    in the data with the help of Sockets; the software then processes
    it into a graph using Matplotlib.}
